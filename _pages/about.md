<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Here is **Yuhao Wu**. I am a PhD student in the [School of Geodesy and Geomatics](https://www.sgg.whu.edu.cn/) at the [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/). My research interests includes GNSS meteorology, tropospheric modeling, and weather forecasting. My current research focus is on water vapor retrieval based on GNSS and remote sensing. In a word, advanced technologies like GNSS influence the life of everybody.  I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.

I have published more than 10 papers at the journals with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RlAdMyYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>50+</span></strong></a>. If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - wyhnbnb@126.com

**<font color="#990000">I am actively seeking a position as a university lecturer in 2028. If you have any information, please contact me!</font>**

[Improving the capability of water vapor retrieval from Landsat 8 using ensemble machine learning](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2023.103407)

**Yuhao Wu**, Nan Jiang, Yan Xu#, et al., 2023. *International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation*. 122, 103407. (JCR Q1, IF=7.5).<br>

- The new method uses Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) to establish the model between brightness temperature, GNSS-derived PWV, and related surface parameters. 
- Compared with SWCVR, the GBDT improves the RMSE and availability by 41.99% and 38.3%, respectively.

[Revealing the water vapor transport during the Henan "7.20" heavy rainstorm based on ERA5 and real-time GNSS](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrs.2024.02.004)

**Yuhao Wu**, Nan Jiang, Yan Xu#, et al., 2024. *Egyptian Journal of Remote Sensing and Space Sciences*. 27, 165-177. (JCR Q2, IF=4.4).<br>
- Different from the normal rainfall, we found that the PWV variation during the Henan rainstorm experienced a unique "accumulation" period.
- In addition, the PWV in the severely damaged area was 20 mm higher than the average value of the past decade. Ten days after the rainstorm, the surface of this area had subsided by 1.5-3 mm.

[First PWV Retrieval using MERSI-LL onboard FY-3E and Cross Validation with Co-platform Occultation and Ground GNSS](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GL108681)

Nan Jiang‚Ä†, **Yuhao Wu‚Ä†**, Song Li, Yan Xu#, et al., 2024. *Geophysical Research Letters*. 51, e2024GL108681. (JCR Q1, IF=5.3).<br>
- Here, we carry out the PWV retrieval using the MERSI-LL sensor onboard the FY-3E satellite for the first time.
- For the results against ground-based GNSS, the total accuracy shows an RMSE of 2.69-3.36 mm as the clouds increase, and correlation coefficients higher than 0.95.

 [PWV retrieval performance evaluation for the fresh BDS-3 with multi-source data](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023EA002923)
 
 Nan Jiang, Zhaorui Gao, **Yuhao Wu**, et al., 2023. *Earth and Space Science*. 10, e2023EA002923. (JCR Q2, IF=3.1). <br>
- From the tests applied with different satellite systems, we found that BDS-3 has a comparable PWV retrieval performance as global positioning system (GPS), and a better outcome was achieved using the combined data from GPS and BDS-3.
