<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Here is **Yuhao Wu**. I am a PhD student in the [School of Geodesy and Geomatics](https://www.sgg.whu.edu.cn/) at the [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/). My research interests includes GNSS meteorology, tropospheric modeling, and weather forecasting. My current research focus is on water vapor retrieval based on GNSS and remote sensing. In a word, advanced technologies like GNSS influence the life of everybody.  I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.

I have published more than 10 papers at the journals with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RlAdMyYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>50+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RlAdMyYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - wyhnbnb@126.com

[Improving the capability of water vapor retrieval from Landsat 8 using ensemble machine learning](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2023.103407)

**Yuhao Wu**, Nan Jiang, Yan Xu#, et al., 2023. *International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation*. 122, 103407. (JCR Q1, IF=7.5).<br>

- The new method uses Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) to establish the model between brightness temperature, GNSS-derived PWV, and related surface parameters. 
- The results show that the improved SWCVR model has an RMSE, Bias, and availability of 0.4947 cm, 0.0276 cm, and 29.6%, respectively. By contrast, the GBDT model's corresponding values are 0.2870 cm, 0.0094 cm, and 67.9%, respectively. 
- Compared with SWCVR, the GBDT improves the RMSE and availability by 41.99% and 38.3%, respectively.
